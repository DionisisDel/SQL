# SQL project Car Rental

This is my first SQL portfolio project. The main purpose of this project is to present some basic SQL queries. I used an example of a car rental company, so I created the tables Clients, Cars and Reserves in order to run the queries. The values I used are random. Feel free to take a look and reach out if you have any questions.
